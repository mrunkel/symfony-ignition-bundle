[Ignition](https://github.com/spatie/ignition) is a beautiful and customizable error page for
PHP applications

Using this bundle, you can replace Symfony's default exception pages with Ignition.

This is what how the Ignition looks like in the browser.

There's also a beautiful dark mode.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

composer require --dev spatie/symfony-ignition-bundle
```

Enable the bundle in `config/bundles.php`:
```diff
 return [
     // ...
+    Spatie\SymfonyIgnitionBundle\IgnitionBundle::class => ['dev' => true],
 ];

```

## Configuration

Use `bin/console debug:config ignition` to see configuration options.

`config/packages/ignition.yaml`:
```
ignition:
    application_path: '%kernel.project_dir%'
    dark_mode: false
    should_display_exceptions: '%kernel.debug%'
    # if you want AI solutions to your app's errors
    openai_key: 'key-here'
```

## Usage

When you now throw an exception anywhere in your app...

```php
class IndexController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index(): Response
    {
        throw new Exception('Hello Ignition!');
    }
}
```

... you'll see a beautiful error page.
